Build requirements:

- kdelibs headers from KDE4
- kgraphviewer 2.1: http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/KGraphViewer+and+KGraphEditor?content=23999

I plan to make the graphviewer dependency optional in future.

When you got all this, you simply do the usual CMake run:

cd massif-visualizer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

That should be it.
